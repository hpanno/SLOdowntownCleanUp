Review and contribute further detail to San Luis Obispo's Downtown area. 


IF there is a single address point for a single business:
1. Create closed ways for areas where the physical bounds of a retail shop are known by splitting existing building footprints. 
Utilize outside resources to help validate where the shop boundaries are i.e. street view, local knowledge, mapillary. 
2. This closed way, which now represents an individual shop, will include only the address information (to be conflated from address 
points if available). Do not include the business name in this closed way.
3. Create a POI (if it doesn't already exist) including the name and type of shop (use the "amenity=" tag for this) as well as all 
address information. If the current POI does not include the address information, add it.

See issue 1 for example of scenario above:

IF there is a single address point for multiple businesses:
1. There will be a single closed way that includes all address information, including a suit or unit (addr:unit=).
2. This closed way will not include any specific business information.
3. Create a POI to represent each business. Include all address and business information in each POI. 

IF there is a two story building follow instructions above for a single address point for multiple businesses.
