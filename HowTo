Goal: Review and contribute further detail to San Luis Obispo's Downtown area. What we want for each business *when possible:*

  1. A building footprint with address info (no business info). That way upon export there is a single footprint with is associated
  address info
  2. POI with address and business info. This POI allows for rendering of the shop name. 


**IF there is a single address point for a single business:**

1. Create a closed way for the area where the physical bounds of the retail shop is known. Utilize outside resources to help validate where the shop boundaries are i.e. street view, local knowledge, mapillary. 
2. This closed way, which now represents an individual shop, will include only the address information (conflate from address points if available). *Do not include the business name in this closed way.*
3. Create a POI (if it doesn't already exist) including the name and type of shop ("amenity=" or "shop=") as well as all address information. If the current POI does not include the address information, add it.

See issue 1 for example of scenario above:

**IF there is a single address point for multiple businesses:**

1. There will be a single closed way that that represents all businesses. This single way will include address information.This closed way
will not include any specific business information.
2. Create a POI to represent each business within the closed way. Each POI will Include all business and address information including the 
business's suit or unit number (addr:unit=)

**IF there is a two story building follow instructions above for a single address point for multiple businesses.**
